= Lambda

This directory contains the source code for the demo Lambda function.

== How to build

The Lambda function in this project is configured to run on AWS Graviton, i.e. ARM architecture.
The `psycopg` package, in turn, depends on the `libpq` library, which is platform-specific.
These two facts make it difficult to build the function in a cross-platform way.

The https://stackoverflow.com/q/76048534/750510[easiest way] to do that is to use Docker:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up # Build the builder container. May take a while

docker-compose run builder make clean
docker-compose run builder make neonbranch.zip # Build the function
----

Make sure to satisfy the prerequisites (like installing the QEMU) listed in the https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform[Multi-platform images].
