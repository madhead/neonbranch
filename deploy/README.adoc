= Deploy

This directory contains https://aws.amazon.com/cdk[AWS CDK] scripts for deploying.
The language of choice is https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/work-with-cdk-python.html[Python].

There is also a non-CDK link:branch.py[`branch.py`] script for https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/branching[NeonDB branching].
It's here for the sake of simplicity: branching logic benefits of an eloquent language like Python, but I was too lazy to extract it in a separate subproject in this repository.
The link:unbranch.by[`unbranch.py`] is the opposite of `branch.py`: it deletes the branch when a PR is closed.

== Useful commands

* `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
